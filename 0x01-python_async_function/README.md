## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that allows you to execute tasks concurrently, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of your programs. This class covers the essential concepts of async programming in Python using the `asyncio` module.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system

## Topics Covered

### Async and Await Syntax

The `async` and `await` keywords are fundamental to writing asynchronous code in Python. Learn how to define asynchronous functions and pause execution using these keywords.

### How to Execute an Async Program with asyncio

Discover how to execute asynchronous programs using the `asyncio` module, which provides the necessary tools and functions.

### How to Run Concurrent Coroutines

Understand how to run multiple coroutines concurrently to improve the efficiency of your programs. Explore functions like `asyncio.gather()` and `asyncio.create_task()`.

### How to Create asyncio Tasks

Learn how to create and manage asyncio tasks to run coroutines concurrently.

### How to Use the Random Module

Use the `random` module to generate random numbers and simulate delays in your asynchronous programs.

## Examples

### Async and Await Syntax
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

asyncio.run(say_hello())
